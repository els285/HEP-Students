## Taking a UK Car to Switzerland

It is possible, and I think desirable, to take your UK car to Switzerland.

### Legal Matters
It is not necessary to import your car if you are there for less than 12 months.
I have also seen that as a student you are exempt from importing for 24 months:
 see `Customs Declarations` on page 3 of [Clearing vehicles through Swiss customs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjlt4KQ0Y3_AhURZcAKHQUuA9MQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valais4you.ch%2F%3Faction%3Dget_file%26id%3D90%26resource_link_id%3D251&usg=AOvVaw0a0CV3kbnTjOUcOV7dVIBk). 
 
 ### Parking
 Parking in Meyrin is in general not free, but in my case the UKLO were able to provide a parking space with my apartment.
 
 ### Driving in Europe
 Drive on the right. 
 You will also need to divert your headlight beams to dip in the other direction, which can be done using stickers placed in the correct place on the headlight. I bought [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eurolites-Deflectors-Headlamp-Converters-GADLANE/dp/B07NV13LRB/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?keywords=headlight+deflectors+for+europe&qid=1684921189&sprefix=headlight+%2Caps%2C1772&sr=8-3-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&smid=A38HKLXVWJP6UO).
 
 ### Driving in Switzerland
You require a vignette to drive on Swiss motorways. Apparently this can be bought at entry points, but I always bought mine at the petrol station in Meyrin. It costs 40CHF and you stick it on the windscreen. To avoid this being a problem when I first brought the car over, I took the D1206 from Bellagarde to Saint-Genis and came into Meyrin via the D948F CERN border. This meant I was never on a Swiss motorway, plus I have never seen the CERN border manned.

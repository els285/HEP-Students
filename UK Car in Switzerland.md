## Taking a UK Car to Switzerland

It is not necessary to import your car if you are there for less than 12 months.
I have also seen that as a student you are exempt from importing for 24 months:
 see `Customs Declarations` on page 3 of [Clearing vehicles through Swiss customs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjlt4KQ0Y3_AhURZcAKHQUuA9MQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valais4you.ch%2F%3Faction%3Dget_file%26id%3D90%26resource_link_id%3D251&usg=AOvVaw0a0CV3kbnTjOUcOV7dVIBk)

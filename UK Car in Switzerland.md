# Taking a UK Car to Switzerland

It is possible, and I think desirable, to take your UK car to Switzerland. This information was valid for my LTA August 2021 - February 2023. I take no responsibility if it is no longer valid.

## Legal Matters
It is not necessary to import your car if you are there for less than 12 months.
I have also seen that as a student you are exempt from importing for 24 months:
 see `Customs Declarations` on page 3 of [Clearing vehicles through Swiss customs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjlt4KQ0Y3_AhURZcAKHQUuA9MQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valais4you.ch%2F%3Faction%3Dget_file%26id%3D90%26resource_link_id%3D251&usg=AOvVaw0a0CV3kbnTjOUcOV7dVIBk). 
 This means your car is still taxed and insured in the UK.
 
 ## Insurance
 I did a lot of research into how to insure my car when it was based in Geneva. The only solution I could find was to use [Stuart Collins](https://www.stuartcollins.com/), who are a broker for AXA Insurance and who provide 12 months international driving cover. Other insurers generally only provided cover for extended holidays e.g. 90 (occasionally 180) days.
 Stuart Collins were expensive (~£600 for a 11 year old 1.4L Vauxhall Astra) but they were also helpful. I also took out full worldwide breakdown cover with them for an extra ~£180. I maintain that for me this expense was worthwhile, and cheaper than buying and insuring a car in Switzerland.
 
 ## MOT
 This part is the biggest pain, and it depends on length of LTA. My advice would be to try to get your car MOT'd before your depart, if you are away for 12 months. I was there for 18 months, and had to drive to Folkestone (UK) to get the car MOT'd. The total cost for that trip was around £700 (fuel, tolls, Eurotunnel, hotel, MOT, Nepalese curry). Stuart Collins required that the car should have a valid MOT. 
 
 ## Driving Requirements
 ### Driving in Europe
 Drive on the right. 
 You will also need to divert your headlight beams to dip in the other direction, which can be done using stickers placed in the correct place on the headlight. I bought [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eurolites-Deflectors-Headlamp-Converters-GADLANE/dp/B07NV13LRB/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?keywords=headlight+deflectors+for+europe&qid=1684921189&sprefix=headlight+%2Caps%2C1772&sr=8-3-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&smid=A38HKLXVWJP6UO).
 You also require a `UK` sticker post-Brexit, not a `GB` sticker. You don't need a green card.
 
 ### Driving in Switzerland
You require a vignette to drive on Swiss motorways. Apparently this can be bought at entry points, but I always bought mine at the petrol station in Meyrin. It costs 40CHF and you stick it on the windscreen. To avoid this being a problem when I first brought the car over, I took the D1206 from Bellagarde to Saint-Genis and came into Meyrin via the D948F CERN border. This meant I was never on a Swiss motorway, plus I have never seen the CERN border manned.

### Driving in France
You are required to have a reflective jacket and an emergency triangle. I think this is still true. 
I bought [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08C2CGMTF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
French tolls are a pain. You have to pay for the motorways at toll booths along the motorway, which is annoying on a right-hand drive car. It was about 80 euros to drive from Calais to Geneva one way. I always paid by contactless debit card.
 
## Car in Switzerland

### Fuel
The cheapest place I found for fuel was E Leclerc in Ferney: [https://goo.gl/maps/Nkg369rkvkrUQAjq5](https://goo.gl/maps/Nkg369rkvkrUQAjq5). This was a good 25% cheaper than Swiss garages for E10.

### Crossing Borders
Occasionally the Ferney-Meyrin border crossing is manned, or the border guard were just further along the road into Meyrin. There is a rule that you can only take 4L of wine and 1kg of meat into Switzerland from France before paying tax, but I was never checked. In the couple of instances that border officers spoke to me, I was able to explain in English where I lived and worked, and had no problems.

 ### Parking
 Parking in Meyrin is in general not free, but in my case the UKLO were able to provide a parking space with my apartment.
 
 ### Registering your car at CERN
 You can't take your car onto the CERN site until it's registered, do that [here](https://home.cern/news/announcement/cern/new-online-registration-vehicles).
 
 ### Maintenance
 I only visited the garage once. I used the garage at Champs Frechets next to DS17. The guy was really nice and spoke decent English, but it was expensive (~350 CHF for service). I've heard there are cheaper garages in France but then you perhaps have to contend with a language barrier.
 
 ### Winter Tyres
I had my winter tyres fitted in September in the UK before I drove over. I kept them on the whole time - it seemed less hassle and expense than finding a garage to change them and a place to store the tyres.
